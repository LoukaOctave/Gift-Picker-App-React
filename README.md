## About

The Gift Picker App is a tool for collecting gift ideas in a very simple way. It helps to pick out the perfect gift for any occasion. Dad's birthday, grandma's and grandpa's anniversary, or even your cousin's bat mitzva; keep all these events in one central place and organize different wish lists for different people.
This offline-first web app allows you to write down your ideas anywhere and anytime - even without an internet connection.

All pages are loaded using [React Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), routing is handled by [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), and most operations are performed using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
