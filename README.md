# [Gift Picker App](https://github.com/LoukaOctave/Gift-Picker-App-React)

## About

The Gift Picker App is a tool for collecting gift ideas in a very simple way. It helps to pick out the perfect gift for any occasion. Dad's birthday, grandma's and grandpa's anniversary, or even your cousin's bat mitzva; keep all these events in one central place and organize different wish lists for different people.
This offline-first web app allows you to write down your ideas anywhere and anytime - even without an internet connection.

## Technologies

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Create React App PWA Template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-template-pwa).

All pages are loaded using [React Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), routing is handled by [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), and most operations are performed using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Offline capabilities are made possible by the ServiceWorker implemented in the CRA PWA Template.

The [Materialize CSS framework](https://materializecss.com/) is used for styling, along with [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) for the icons.

[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is an essential part of this app, as it manages authentication through [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?authuser=0), database through [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?authuser=0), and hosting through [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting?authuser=0).

## File Structure

The app was created using Create React App and the CRA PWA Template (see [Technologies](#Technologies) for reference). In this section I want to explain the changes I've brought to this file structure and the content of these files, but also the files I've added to this project.

### ```./build-deploy-script.txt```

Contains commands employed when building and (re)deploying a new version of the app.

### ```./public/404.html```

Generated by Firebase CLI when configuring hosting for the app. Completely unnused by that the app.

### ```./public/index.html```

This is the central point of the app; the page that's loaded when someone opens the app. However, none of this file's contents are ever shown, as the actual app content gets loaded through scripts. This mainly contains ```<meta/>``` and ```<link/>``` tags that are necessary for the app to work.

### ```./public/favicon.ico```, ```./public/logo192.png```, and ```./public/logo512.png```

All of these files contain the logo of the app, to be used in different places (for example: icon on bookmarks, or app icon when app is downloaded onto mobile device). These are used within ```./public/index.html``` and linked to in ```./public/manifest.json```

### ```./public/manifest.json```

Contains metadata such as name of the app, links to icons and logo images to use.

### ```./src/App.js```

Contains code that is used throughout all pages of the app (navigation & routes).

### ```./src/data.js```

Contains all kinds of constant data objects that are used in different components of the App (event types, placeholders, ...).

### ```./src/functions.js```

Contains all kinds of functions that are used in different components of the App (data conversion, form checking, ...).

### ```./src/index.js```

This renders the ```<BrowserRouter/>``` and ```<App/>``` components, and registers the ```ServiceWorker```.

### ```./src/components/Home.js```



### ```./src/components/DateInfoCard.js```



### ```./src/components/CreateEvent.js```



### ```./src/components/ReadEvent.js```



### ```./src/components/UpdateEvent.js```



### ```./src/components/Firebase.js```

Contains the Firebase configuration and options for accessing the Firestore. This is exported for use in other app components.
